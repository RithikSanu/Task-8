Loads the dataset and selects two features: Annual Income and Spending Score.

Scales the features to normalize data for better clustering.

Uses the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (K) by plotting inertia vs. K.

Trains a K-Means model (e.g., with K=5), assigns cluster labels, and visualizes the results.

Evaluates clustering quality using the Silhouette Score, which measures how well each point fits its assigned cluster.

This script demonstrates unsupervised learning with K-Means and includes all key steps: scaling, training, visualizing, and evaluating.
